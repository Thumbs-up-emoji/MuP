q2.
    mov ax, num ; load the number into ax
    mov bx, 31  ; load 31 into bx to mask the last 5 bits
    and ax, bx  ; mask the last 5 bits of the number
    cmp ax, 0   ; compare the result with 0
    jne 200     ; if the result is not zero, jump to memory location 200

; memory location 100: code to execute if the number is divisible by 32
    jmp 300     ; jump to memory location 300 (end of the program)

; memory location 200: code to execute if the number is not divisible by 32
